# Rat-in-a-maze
A "rat in a maze" is a classic metaphorical scenario often used in various contexts, including computer science, psychology, and decision-making studies. It refers to a simple yet illustrative problem where a hypothetical rat is placed within a maze and must navigate through it to reach a specific goal or exit point.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze [0][0] of the above figure and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze [N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. The rat can move in four directions: right, left, top and down. In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. We have used matrix for the representation of the maze and graph to figure out the movement of the rat where the rat cannot move toward the dead block. 
This project shows the simulation of a mouseâ€™s movement through the maze and shows the path through the maze moved by the mouse.
